## Quality Gates

## Team Communication Protocols

### Information Handoffs
**Planner → Researcher**: Topic focus, key questions, audience needs
**Researcher → Scene Planner**: Facts to visualize, emphasis points
**Scene Planner → Script Writer**: Scene structure, pacing guide, visual cues
**Everyone → Description Writer**: Key points, sources, keywords, highlights

### Feedback Loops
- Researcher can request clarification from Planner
- Script Writer can request additional facts from Researcher
- Description Writer can request script summaries
- Scene Planner coordinates with Script Writer on pacing

### Conflict Resolution
