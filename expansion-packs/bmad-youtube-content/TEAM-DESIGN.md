# YouTube Video Script Creation Team - Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a specialized BMAD team focused on creating comprehensive YouTube video scripts with proper research, documentation, and source attribution. The team follows a structured workflow from concept to final deliverables while maintaining flexibility for human creative input.
