- Engagement hooks

### 8. Create Summary Sections
Provide overview sections:
- Executive summary of findings
- Main message support points
- Key takeaways
- Suggested narrative arc
- Recommended emphasis areas

### 9. Add Metadata
Include research metadata:

- Search methods used
- Databases consulted
- Limitations encountered
- Reliability assessment

### 10. Format for Usability
Ensure the document is:
- Easy to navigate
- Clearly formatted
- Mobile-friendly
- Searchable
- Well-indexed
