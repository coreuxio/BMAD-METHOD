# Task: Assess Source Credibility

## Objective
Evaluate the credibility, reliability, and authority of sources to ensure the video content is built on trustworthy information and meets professional standards.

## Context
Not all sources are created equal. This task ensures that facts used in the video come from credible sources and that any limitations or biases are identified and acknowledged.

## Prerequisites
- Sources identified and collected
- Access to source materials
- Understanding of topic domain
- Awareness of credibility standards

## Steps

### 1. Evaluate Source Authority
Assess the expertise and credentials:
- Identify author/organization credentials
- Check relevant expertise in subject matter
- Verify institutional affiliations
- Review publication history
- Confirm professional standing

### 2. Check Publication Credibility
Evaluate the publishing platform:
- Peer-reviewed journals (highest credibility)
- Established news organizations
- Government/educational institutions
- Industry organizations
- Self-published/blog content (verify carefully)

### 3. Verify Information Currency
Check timeliness and relevance:
- Publication date
- Last update date
- Whether information is still current
- If newer research supersedes it
- Relevance to current context

### 4. Assess Objectivity and Bias
Identify potential biases:
- Author's potential conflicts of interest
- Funding sources
- Political or ideological leanings
- Commercial interests
- Balanced presentation of views

### 5. Cross-Reference Information
Validate through multiple sources:
- Find corroborating sources
- Check for consensus in field
- Identify outlier claims
- Note controversial aspects
- Document disagreements

### 6. Evaluate Evidence Quality
Assess the supporting evidence:
- Primary vs secondary sources
- Sample size and methodology
- Statistical significance
- Reproducibility of findings
- Transparency of methods

### 7. Check Domain-Specific Standards
Apply field-appropriate criteria:
- **Scientific**: Peer review, reproducibility
- **Medical**: Clinical trials, FDA approval
- **Legal**: Court decisions, legislation
- **Historical**: Primary documents, archaeological evidence
- **Technical**: Industry standards, documentation

### 8. Rate Source Credibility
Assign credibility ratings:
- **High**: Peer-reviewed, expert-authored, well-cited
- **Medium**: Reputable but not peer-reviewed
- **Low**: Opinion pieces, unverified claims
- **Use with caution**: Potential bias or conflicts

### 9. Document Limitations
Note any concerns:
- Potential biases identified
- Limitations of study/data
- Conflicting information found
- Missing information
- Need for additional verification

### 10. Create Credibility Report
Compile assessment results:
- Source-by-source evaluation
- Overall credibility rating
- Recommendations for use
- Attribution requirements
- Suggested caveats

## Expected Outputs

### Credibility Assessment Report
For each source, document:
- Source identification
- Authority evaluation
- Credibility rating
- Potential biases
- Recommended usage
- Attribution notes

### Categories to Assess

#### High-Credibility Sources
- Peer-reviewed research
- Government statistics
- Established institutions
- Recognized experts
- Primary documents

#### Medium-Credibility Sources
- Reputable news outlets
- Industry reports
- Expert blogs
- Professional organizations
- Well-regarded books

#### Low-Credibility Sources
- Opinion pieces
- Unverified claims
- Anonymous sources
- Outdated information
- Biased presentations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All sources evaluated
- [ ] Authority verified
- [ ] Bias assessed
- [ ] Currency checked
- [ ] Cross-references completed
- [ ] Ratings assigned
- [ ] Limitations documented
- [ ] Report compiled
- [ ] Recommendations clear

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Source Red Flags
- No author identified
- No publication date
- Broken citations
- Emotional language
- Selling something
- No supporting evidence
- Claims seem too good/bad

### Content Red Flags
- Conspiracy theories
- Pseudoscience
- Logical fallacies
- Cherry-picked data
- Misrepresented research
- Out-of-context quotes

## Credibility Quick Check
1. **Who** - Author expertise?
2. **What** - Evidence quality?
3. **When** - How current?
4. **Where** - Reputable platform?
5. **Why** - Purpose and bias?
6. **How** - Methodology sound?

## Time Estimate
- Initial assessment: 3-5 minutes per source
- Cross-referencing: 10-15 minutes total
- Documentation: 10-15 minutes
- Total: 30-60 minutes depending on source count

## Next Steps
After credibility assessment:
1. Flag any problematic sources
2. Suggest alternative sources if needed
3. Note attribution requirements
4. Update research document
5. Brief script writer on limitations
