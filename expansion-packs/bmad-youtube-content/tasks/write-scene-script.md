# Task: Write Scene Script

## Objective
Transform the scene outline into engaging, natural-sounding script copy that integrates researched facts with proper attribution while maintaining conversational flow and providing optional visual guidance.

## Script Writing Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Review Materials**:
   - Scene outline (structure and flow)
   - Research document (facts and sources)
   - Video plan (tone and style)
   - Target audience profile

2. **Voice Calibration**:
   ```
   Determine:
   - Formality level (casual → professional)
   - Energy level (calm → enthusiastic)
   - Personality traits (friendly, authoritative, humorous)
   - Speaking patterns (short sentences vs. flowing)
   ```

### Phase 2: Writing Techniques

1. **Write for the Ear**:
   ```
   Good for Speaking:
   - "Here's the thing..."
   - "Think about it this way..."
   - "Now, you might be wondering..."
   - "Let me show you..."

   Avoid:
   - Complex subordinate clauses
   - Written-only phrases ("As aforementioned...")
   - Tongue twisters
   - Excessive technical jargon
   ```

2. **Natural Fact Integration**:
   ```
   Smooth Attribution:
   - "Research from MIT found something fascinating..."
   - "According to a recent study..."
   - "The data tells an interesting story..."
   - "Experts at NASA discovered..."

   Avoid:
   - "A study published in the Journal of..."
   - Citation-style references
   - Breaking flow for sources
   ```

### Phase 3: Scene-by-Scene Writing

1. **Hook/Cold Open**:
   ```
   Techniques:
   - Start with a question
   - Share surprising fact
   - Make bold statement
   - Tell micro-story
   - Create curiosity gap

   Example:
   "What if I told you [surprising fact]? Well, it's true, and by the end of this video..."
   ```

2. **Main Content Blocks**:
   ```
   Structure:
   - Topic introduction (conversational)
   - Fact presentation (with attribution)
   - Explanation/context
   - Example or analogy
   - Transition to next point

   Flow Pattern:
   "So let's talk about [topic]. [Introduce concept].
   Now, [Expert/Source] found that [fact].
   What this means is [explanation].
   Think of it like [analogy].
   But here's where it gets interesting..."
   ```

3. **Visual and Editor Notes**:
   ```
   Format:
   **[VISUAL NOTE: Suggestion for what could appear on screen]**
   **[EDITOR NOTE: Flexibility point or alternative approach]**

   Examples:
   **[VISUAL NOTE: Graph showing growth over time]**
   **[EDITOR NOTE: Feel free to add energy here with cuts]**
   ```

### Phase 4: Engagement Techniques

1. **Direct Address**:
   - "You might be thinking..."
   - "I know what you're wondering..."
   - "Here's what you need to know..."
   - "Let me ask you this..."

2. **Storytelling Elements**:
   - Personal anecdotes
   - Case studies
   - Hypothetical scenarios
   - Before/after comparisons

3. **Rhythm and Pacing**:
   ```
   Vary Sentence Length:
   Short. Medium for explanation. Then a longer sentence that really develops the idea and gives the viewer time to process.

   Use Pauses:
   "This is important... [pause indicated]"
   "But wait... there's more."
   ```

## Source Attribution Strategies

### Natural Integration Methods:

1. **Conversation Style**:
   - "I was reading this Harvard study that said..."
   - "Scientists just discovered..."
   - "The team at Google found..."

2. **Authority Building**:
   - "[Expert name], who literally wrote the book on this..."
   - "The leading researcher in this field says..."
   - "After 10 years of study, they found..."

3. **Story Format**:
   - "Back in [year], researchers noticed..."
   - "When [Company] tested this..."
   - "The experiment revealed..."

## Script Formatting

### Standard Format:
```markdown
## Scene [#]: [Title]
**[Duration]**

**SCRIPT:**
[Spoken text in natural, conversational flow]

[Continue with script...]

**[VISUAL NOTE: Optional visual suggestion]**

**[EDITOR NOTE: Creative flexibility point]**

---
```

## Quality Checks

### Read Aloud Test:
- [ ] Sounds natural when spoken
- [ ] No tongue twisters
- [ ] Breathing points included
- [ ] Energy maintains throughout

### Content Checks:
- [ ] Facts properly attributed
- [ ] Core message clear
- [ ] Transitions smooth
- [ ] Visual notes marked optional
- [ ] Personality consistent

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-writing**: Too many words for the time
2. **Under-attributing**: Facts without sources
3. **Rigid visuals**: Prescriptive rather than suggestive
4. **Monotone pacing**: No rhythm variation
5. **Jargon overload**: Too technical for audience
6. **Weak hooks**: Not grabbing attention immediately
7. **Unclear CTA**: Vague ending instructions

## Script Variations

### By Genre:
- **Educational**: More facts, clear structure
- **Entertainment**: More personality, humor
- **Tutorial**: Step-by-step clarity
- **Review**: Personal opinion with evidence
- **Documentary**: Narrative flow with authority

## Output

**Primary**: video-script.md - Complete script with all scenes
**Secondary**: Speaker notes with timing and emphasis marks
