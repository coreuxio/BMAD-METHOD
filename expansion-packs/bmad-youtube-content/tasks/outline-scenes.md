# Task: Outline Scenes

## Objective
Transform the video concept and research into a structured scene-by-scene outline that maximizes engagement, properly paces information delivery, and provides flexible visual guidance.

## Scene Planning Process

### Phase 1: Structure Analysis

1. **Review Inputs**:
   - Video plan (core message, audience, goals)
   - Research document (facts to include)
   - Target duration and format
   - Platform considerations

2. **Determine Structure Type**:
   ```
   Common Structures:
   - Problem â†’ Solution
   - Chronological narrative
   - Three-act structure
   - Comparison/contrast
   - Building complexity
   - Mystery/reveal
   ```

### Phase 2: Scene Breakdown

1. **Essential Scenes**:
   ```
   Scene 1: Hook (5-10 seconds)
   - Immediate attention grab
   - Tease value proposition
   - Create curiosity gap

   Scene 2: Introduction (20-30 seconds)
   - Establish topic
   - Build credibility
   - Set expectations

   Scenes 3-5: Main Content (60-90 seconds each)
   - Core information blocks
   - Progressive complexity
   - Fact integration points

   Scene 6: Application (30-45 seconds)
   - Practical takeaways
   - Action steps
   - Real-world connection

   Scene 7: Conclusion/CTA (20-30 seconds)
   - Recap key points
   - Final thought
   - Clear next action
   ```

2. **For Each Scene Define**:
   - Purpose (why this scene exists)
   - Duration (time estimate)
   - Information to present
   - Facts from research to include
   - Visual suggestions [OPTIONAL]
   - Transition to next scene

### Phase 3: Information Mapping

1. **Distribute Research Facts**:
   - Assign facts to relevant scenes
   - Balance information density
   - Plan attribution moments
   - Avoid fact overload

2. **Pacing Considerations**:
   ```
   High Energy Points:
   - Opening hook
   - Major revelations
   - Visual demonstrations
   - Closing CTA

   Breathing Room:
   - After complex information
   - Between major points
   - Before climax
   ```

### Phase 4: Visual Planning

1. **Visual Suggestions** (Always Optional):
   ```
   [VISUAL NOTE: This is a suggestion, not a requirement]

   Types:
   - B-roll suggestions
   - Animation concepts
   - Text overlay ideas
   - Transition styles
   - Demonstration shots
   ```

2. **Editor Flexibility Notes**:
   ```
   [EDITOR NOTE: Feel free to interpret creatively]

   Areas for creativity:
   - Visual style
   - Transition types
   - B-roll selection
   - Effect choices
   - Pacing adjustments
   ```

## Engagement Optimization

### Retention Techniques

1. **Pattern Interrupts**:
   - Change visual style
   - Shift energy level
   - Ask questions
   - Tease upcoming content

2. **Curiosity Loops**:
   - Open questions early
   - Promise reveals
   - Build anticipation
   - Deliver payoffs

3. **Value Markers**:
   - "Here's the important part..."
   - "This changed everything..."
   - "Most people don't know..."
   - "The key insight is..."

## Scene Timing Guidelines

### Standard Video (6-8 minutes):
- Hook: 5-10 seconds
- Intro: 20-30 seconds
- Main Block 1: 90 seconds
- Main Block 2: 90 seconds
- Main Block 3: 90 seconds
- Application: 45 seconds
- Conclusion: 30 seconds
- Buffer: 30-60 seconds

### Adjust for:
- **Shorter (3-4 min)**: Combine main blocks
- **Longer (10+ min)**: Add depth to each block
- **Tutorials**: Extend application section
- **Essays**: Balance all sections equally

## Output Format

### Scene Outline Structure:
```markdown
### Scene [#]: [Scene Title] (Time)

**Duration**: [X seconds/minutes]

**Purpose**:
[Why this scene is essential]

**Information to Present**:
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- [Fact from research]

**[VISUAL SUGGESTIONS]**:
- [Optional visual idea]
- [Another option for editor]

**Transition**:
[How to move to next scene]
```
