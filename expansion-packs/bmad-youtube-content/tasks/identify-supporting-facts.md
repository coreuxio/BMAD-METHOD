# Task: Identify Supporting Facts

## Objective
Determine what specific facts, data, and evidence are needed to support the video's core message and create a research roadmap.

## Process

### Phase 1: Message Decomposition

1. **Break Down Core Message**:
   - Identify key claims
   - Note assumptions
   - Find potential objections
   - Determine proof points needed

2. **Categorize Support Needs**:
   ```
   Categories:
   - Statistical proof
   - Expert validation
   - Case studies/examples
   - Historical context
   - Scientific explanation
   - Comparative data
   ```

### Phase 2: Fact Mapping

**Elicit: true**
**Format: brainstorm**

1. **For Each Claim**:
   - What fact would prove this?
   - What would skeptics question?
   - What context is needed?
   - What examples illustrate it?

2. **Priority Matrix**:
   ```
   Essential Facts (Must Have):
   - Core claim support
   - Credibility builders
   - Key statistics

   Supporting Facts (Should Have):
   - Additional examples
   - Interesting context
   - Comparative data

   Nice-to-Have Facts:
   - Tangential information
   - Deep-dive details
   - Historical background
   ```

### Phase 3: Research Planning

1. **Source Identification**:
   - Where to find each fact type
   - Preferred source quality
   - Backup source options
   - Time estimates

2. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Citation needs
   - Visual data potential
   - Quote opportunities
   - Controversy flags

## Deliverables
