# Task: Research Topics

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive web research to find, verify, and document facts that support the video's core message, with proper source attribution and credibility assessment.

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Research Planning

1. **Review Video Plan**:
   - Extract core message
   - Identify required facts
   - Note research priorities
   - List specific questions to answer

2. **Create Research Strategy**:
   - Define search parameters
   - Identify authoritative sources
   - Set credibility standards
   - Plan verification approach

### Phase 2: Information Gathering

1. **Primary Research** (STEM/Technical Topics):
   ```
   Search Priority:
   1. Peer-reviewed journals
   2. Government databases
   3. Academic institutions
   4. Industry research reports
   5. Expert interviews/quotes
   ```

2. **Search Techniques**:
   - Use specific search operators
   - Check publication dates (prefer recent)
   - Verify author credentials
   - Cross-reference multiple sources
   - Save all source URLs

3. **Fact Categories to Research**:
   - Statistical data
   - Scientific findings
   - Historical facts
   - Expert opinions
   - Case studies
   - Technical specifications

### Phase 3: Source Verification

1. **Credibility Assessment**:
   ```
   High Credibility:
   - Peer-reviewed studies
   - Government statistics
   - Recognized institutions
   - Industry leaders

   Medium Credibility:
   - Reputable news outlets
   - Industry reports
   - Expert blogs
   - Well-sourced articles

   Low Credibility:
   - Opinion pieces
   - Unverified claims
   - Anonymous sources
   - Outdated information
   ```

2. **Verification Steps**:
   - Check multiple sources for same fact
   - Verify author/organization reputation
   - Look for potential bias
   - Confirm data recency
   - Note any controversies

### Phase 4: Documentation

1. **For Each Fact Document**:
   - Exact statement/claim
   - Complete source citation
   - Direct URL
   - Credibility rating
   - Usage notes for script
   - Attribution phrase suggestion

2. **Organization Structure**:
   - Group by topic/scene
   - Prioritize by importance
   - Note confidence levels
   - Flag any gaps

## Special Considerations

### STEM/Science Topics
**MANDATORY**: All claims must have verifiable sources
- Prefer primary sources
- Include methodology when relevant
- Note sample sizes
- Mention limitations

### Personal Experience Content
**CLEARLY MARK**: No sources needed but identify as:
- "Personal experience"
- "Creator's opinion"
- "Anecdotal evidence"

### Controversial Topics
- Present multiple viewpoints
- Use balanced sources
- Note areas of debate
- Suggest neutral framing

## Research Output Format

### For Each Researched Fact:
