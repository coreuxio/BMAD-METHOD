# Task: Polish Script Flow

## Objective
Refine script for natural delivery, smooth flow, and optimal pacing.

## Process

### Phase 1: Read-Aloud Testing

1. **Full Read-Through**:
   - Read entire script aloud
   - Mark awkward phrases
   - Note breathing points
   - Identify tongue twisters
   - Time each section

2. **Problem Identification**:
   - Overly long sentences
   - Unnatural phrasing
   - Missing transitions
   - Pacing issues
   - Energy dips

### Phase 2: Flow Refinement

1. **Sentence Polish**:
   - Shorten complex sentences
   - Add contractions for naturalness
   - Vary sentence length
   - Remove redundancy
   - Clarify ambiguity

2. **Transition Smoothing**:
   - Bridge between topics
   - Add connecting phrases
   - Ensure logical progression
   - Maintain momentum
   - Create natural segues

### Phase 3: Pacing Optimization

1. **Rhythm Adjustment**:
   - Mix short and long sentences
   - Add pauses for emphasis
   - Build to climax points
   - Allow processing time
   - Maintain energy variation

2. **Final Timing**:
   - Verify section durations
   - Adjust for target length
   - Ensure balanced proportions
   - Add buffer time
   - Mark optional cuts
