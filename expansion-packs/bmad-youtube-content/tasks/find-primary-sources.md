# Task: Find Primary Sources

## Objective
Locate and retrieve primary sources that provide first-hand evidence and original information to support the video's content with maximum credibility.

## Context
Primary sources are original materials that provide direct evidence about a topic. They are the most credible form of information and essential for fact-based content, especially in STEM, science, and educational videos.

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of video topic
- Knowledge of what constitutes primary sources
- Access to academic/research databases
- Understanding of search techniques

## Steps

### 1. Identify Primary Source Types
Determine what primary sources are relevant:
- **Research**: Original studies, data sets, experiments
- **Historical**: Documents, artifacts, recordings
- **Legal**: Laws, court cases, regulations
- **Scientific**: Research papers, clinical trials
- **Expert**: Direct interviews, speeches, statements
- **Data**: Government statistics, surveys, polls

### 2. Search Academic Databases

- Locate the primary research
- Verify the actual findings
- Confirm context accuracy

### 9. Evaluate Accessibility
Check source availability:
- Open access status
- Paywall restrictions
- Free alternatives
- Preprint availability
- Summary documents
- Press releases

### 10. Archive Sources
Preserve access to sources:

- Anonymous authorship

## Time Estimate
- Initial search: 20-30 minutes
- Source verification: 15-20 minutes
- Document retrieval: 10-15 minutes
- Archiving: 10-15 minutes
- Total: 55-80 minutes

## Next Steps
After finding primary sources:
1. Verify authenticity
2. Assess credibility
3. Extract relevant information
4. Document properly
5. Integrate into research document
